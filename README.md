# Modulo Squares

A Firebase-powered puzzle game built with Flutter, featuring in-app purchases, ads, and cross-platform support.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Modulo Squares is a strategic puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid where players move numbered tiles to clear the board using modulo arithmetic. The core mechanic involves moving tiles into adjacent squares - when a tile's value is less than or equal to the target square's value, a modulo operation occurs, potentially clearing tiles and advancing the game.

**Objective:** Clear the entire board of numbers to win!

## 🐳 Containerization & Docker

The project includes Docker containerization for web and API components, enabling consistent deployments across environments.

### Docker Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- Docker Hub account (for image publishing)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Set up Docker Hub authentication
./setup-docker-auth.sh

# Build and run web app locally
cd packages/web
docker build -t modulo-squares-web .
docker run -p 8080:80 modulo-squares-web

# Build and run API locally
cd packages/functions
docker build -t modulo-squares-api .
docker run -p 3000:3000 modulo-squares-api
```

### Docker Images

- **`packages/web/Dockerfile`**: Multi-stage build for the Flutter web app
  - Build stage: Compiles Flutter web assets
  - Runtime stage: Nginx serving static files with production optimizations
- **`packages/functions/Dockerfile`**: Node.js container for Firebase Functions API
  - Includes Express server wrapper for containerized deployment

### CI/CD with Docker

The GitHub Actions pipeline automatically:
- Builds Docker images for web and API components
- Pushes images to Docker Hub with version tags
- Deploys containers to production environments

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub Personal Access Token

For detailed Docker authentication setup, see [DOCKER_AUTH_SETUP.md](docs/DOCKER_AUTH_SETUP.md).

### Local Development with Docker

```bash
# Run full stack with Docker Compose (future enhancement)
# docker-compose up

# Or run individual services
docker run -d --name web-app -p 8080:80 modulo-squares-web:latest

### Architecture Principles

- **Feature-based**: Code organized by business features rather than technical layers
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation between data, domain, and presentation layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected using GetIt for testability
