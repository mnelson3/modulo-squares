# Modulo Squares

A Firebase-powered puzzle game built with Flutter, featuring in-app purchases, ads, and cross-platform support.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Modulo Squares is a strategic puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid where players move numbered tiles to clear the board using modulo arithmetic. The core mechanic involves moving tiles into adjacent squares - when a tile's value is less than or equal to the target square's value, a modulo operation occurs, potentially clearing tiles and advancing the game.

**Objective:** Clear the entire board of numbers to win!

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows a **feature-based clean architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```

```

### Architecture Principles

- **Feature-based**: Code organized by business features rather than technical layers
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation between data, domain, and presentation layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected using GetIt for testability
- **Immutable Models**: Game state managed with immutable data structures
- **Platform Agnostic**: Core logic separated from platform-specific code
